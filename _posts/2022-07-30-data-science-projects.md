<h2 id="Introduction">
As a Chinese Malaysian, my education was a linguistic melting pot where English, Chinese, and Malay were all integral parts of my education. Among these languages, Malay, the national language, was the one I struggled with the most. And ever since moving to the States, I became even more less in tune with my Malay language skills. However, I'd still want to be in touch with Malaysian politics. Therefore, this project was created to connect with my country's politics and hopefully make it accessible to others who face similar linguistic hurdles.

Over the past 16 NBA seasons, inter-conference regular season matchups of two eventual playoffs/lottery teams have swung in favor of the Western Conference. In addition, the skill gap between playoff teams from East vs. West has been closer than Western Conference playoff teams vs. Eastern lottery opponents.

The dots on the plot represent teams from the 2005-2020 NBA seasons, colored based on their conference. A team’s point margin increases along the horizontal axis, whereas a team’s strength of schedule increases along the vertical axis. The placement of most red dots suggest a tougher strength of schedule for Western Conference teams than Eastern Conference teams.

There are two labeled teams on this plot -- DAL 2011 and LAL 2019. Compared to other teams, these two teams had a tough schedule due to their opponents’ high point margins. My hypotheses as to why teams from 2019 and 2011 appear at the extremes of this graph was an NBA Lockout that occurred in 2011, and the Covid-19 pandemic that have impacted the 2019-2020 NBA season. Both events caused teams to play fewer games, and a small sample of games fails to standardize team point margins. This produces abnormal values that are plotted at the extremes of this graph.

![Simulations](/assets/img/uploads/simulations.png "Simulations")

I investigated whether it’s possible that the relationship found in the previous analyses could be reasonably explained by randomness. 

After 1000 simulations, I created a plot confirming that a team in the West requires a higher win percentage than a team in the East in order to reach the playoffs.

I also recommended machine learning models to help make data-driven decisions within the NBA.
