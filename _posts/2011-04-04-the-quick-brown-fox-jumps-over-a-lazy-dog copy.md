<h2 class="toc_title">Introduction</h2>

This project delves into the application of advanced programming and computational finance techniques to analyze and predict movements in financial markets. By employing a range of machine learning models and feature engineering techniques, this repository showcases the predictive power of historical market data on the S&P 500 index. The features engineered include various technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Exponential Weighted Moving Averages (EWM) Crossovers, Exponential Weighted Volatility, and Simple Moving Averages (SMA), providing a deep dive into predictive modeling strategies. 

<h3 class="toc_title">Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python</li>
  <li><strong>Libraries and Tools:</strong> Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tensorflow</li>
  <li><strong>Financial Analysis Tools:</strong> Arima, LSTM, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Mean Reversion</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="toc_title">Feature Engineering Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Relative Strength Index (RSI):</strong> Calculated periods of 10, 30, 60, and 200 to gauge the momentum.</li>
  <li><strong>Exponential Weighted Moving (EWM) Crossovers:</strong> Includes combinations like 10/30, 10/60, and 30/60 to identify potential buy or sell signals.</li>
  <li><strong>Exponential Weighted Volatility:</strong> Measured for 10/30, 10/60, and 30/60 periods to assess market risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple Moving Average (SMA):</strong> Periods of 21, 63, and 252 help smooth out price data and identify trends.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="toc_title">Predictive Modeling</h2>
<p>The project includes several models to predict the direction of the SPY500 based on its returns:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Direction Determination:</strong> The target variable 'Direction' is derived from the returns (log difference of adjusted close prices shifted by -5 days). A positive return sets the direction to 1 (up), and a negative return sets it to 0 (down).</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="toc_title">Modeling Strategies</h2>
<h3 class="toc_title">Ensemble Model</h3>
<p>This strategy combines the strengths of three machine learning algorithmsâ€”XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). I utilize 70% of the data for training and applied K-Fold Cross Validation to ensure the models generalize well on unseen data. XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, KNN achieved a mean accuracy of 0.6026, 0.6017, and 0.6197 respectively.</p>
<p>I aggregate the predictions from each model to form an 'ensembled' score for each instance. If the cumulative score from all models exceeds 1, we predict the market direction as 1 (positive trend), otherwise, it is 0 (negative trend).</p>
<p>I multiply the ensemble predictions by the daily returns to calculate the strategy's performance. By applying the exponential function to the cumulative sum of the returns adjusted by our model's prediction, I derive the growth of a hypothetical investment over time under each strategy.</p>

<h3 class="toc_title">LSTM Model</h3>
<p>With the next strategy, I utilize a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock returns using a walk-forward validation approach with a sequence length of 2 days. The network consists of 2 layers with 100 and 50 neurons respectively. The LSTM model then outputs a forecast of daily returns, which we use to determine trading positions. The positions are then multiplied with the predicted returns which they are cumulatively summed and exponentiated to calculate strategy returns.</p>

<h3 class="toc_title">Mean Reversion</h3>
<p>Lastly, we examine the results for a Mean Reversion strategy. This strategy is based on the premise that prices and returns eventually move back towards the average. This model leverages Simple Moving Averages (SMA) to identify potential buy or sell opportunities when prices deviate significantly from their historical averages.</p>
<p>I use the SMA_21 and SMA_63 as short-term and medium-term moving averages, respectively, to gauge market trends and potential mean-reverting points. If SMA_21 is less than SMA_63, it suggests a potential upward mean reversion (signal set to 1), otherwise a downward reversion (signal set to -1). We then compute the strategy returns by multiplying the positions and the generated signals. To examine the overall strategy performance over time, I calculate the cumulative returns of this strategy by applying the exponential function to the cumulative sum of the strategy's daily returns.</p>

<h2 class="toc_title">Results</h2>
<p>The best-performing strategy is the ensemble model. By multiplying the last value of the ensembled model's cumulative returns, it resulted in a portfolio value of $2,762,969 from an initial investment of $500,000.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Maximum Drawdown: 13.84%</li>
    <li>Longest Drawdown Period: 463 days</li>
    <li>Sharpe Ratio: 3.92</li>
    <li>Compound Annual Growth Rate: 37.60%</li>
</ul>

<p>The second-best model was the LSTM model. The strategy resulted in a final value of $994,000.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Maximum Drawdown: 29.68%</li>
    <li>Longest Drawdown period: 392 days</li>
    <li>Sharpe Ratio: 1.54</li>
    <li>Compound Annual Growth Rate: 13.69%</li>
</ul>

<p>The third-best model was the Mean Reversion strategy. The mean reversion strategy concluded with a portfolio value of $539,734.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Maximum Drawdown: 47.64%</li>
    <li>Longest Drawdown period: 659 days</li>
    <li>Sharpe Ratio: 0.057</li>
    <li>Compound Annual Growth Rate: 1.44%</li>
</ul>
