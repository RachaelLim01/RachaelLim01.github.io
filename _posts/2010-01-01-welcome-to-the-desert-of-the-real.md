# About Me

/assets/img/kl.jpeg

Hello! My name is Rachael Lim. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Statistics and Data Science with a minor in Digital Humanities at the University of California, Los Angeles. I chose to pursue this major because I enjoy problem-solving, being sure of things, and making data-driven decisions is my way of doing that. I am open to roles as a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and UIUX Designer. My experiences with data mostly focus on organizing data or making strategic recommendations -- feel free to read the posts to learn more about my experiences!

A little about my background is that I was born and raised in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and moved to the States for high school to further my education. The picture provided above and on the home page is the city I grew up in! I feel extremely blessed to have the opportunity to be exposed to two completely different cultures as it contributes to my versatile perspective.


I know a lot can change in the next few years of my life, but I truly enjoy learning and hope to never stop seeking new learning opportunities.

> ##### Believe in yourself

This is one of my favorite quotes. I look at the abundance of opportunities available for me in UCLA, academia, and extracurricular activities... and I told myself that I should at least give them a shot -- even if I feel unqualified, even if I doubt myself, even if everyone else seems to be much better at it than me.

I transferred to UCLA after the COVID-19 pandemic settled down, which meant that my first two years of college were completely remote due to the situation at hand. Therefore, when I first transferred to UCLA, I felt underqualified and overwhelmed about the missed opportunities. However, fueled by perseverance, persistence, and determination to thrive in my chosen field, I engaged in a series of impactful experiences. I participated in and won a Hackathon, completed a research project, and ran a small online business in the summer within the first year after transferring. 

Although I could not land an internship in the summer, I transformed this setback into an opportunity for self-growth. With the technical skills that I have obtained through coursework and self-learning, I established my first online business. The cherry on top for me during this summer was utilizing my technical skillset to improve my own business. I gained valuable insights into my work ethic and entrepreneurship. I am so glad that I believed in myself.

I hope this website can give you a glimpse of my life as well as my passion for my future career!

Happy Binge Read(ing) ~
