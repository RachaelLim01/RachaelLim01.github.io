   Hello! My name is Rachael Lim. I am currently pursuing a Statistics and Data Science Bachelor's degree with a minor in Digital Humanities at University of California, Los Angeles. I chose to pursue this major because I enjoy problem solving, data analysis, and creating impactful results. Therefore, by utilizing data, it allows me to make data-driven decisions to enhance the efficiency for others. I will be graduating in June of 2024 and I am open to roles in Data Analyst and Data Sciencist.

Hello! My name is Rachael Lim. I am currently pursuing a Statistics and Data Science Bachelor's degree with a minor in Digital Humanities at University of California, Los Angeles. I chose to pursue this major because I enjoy problem solving, data analysis, and creating impactful results. Therefore, by utilizing data, it allows me to make data-driven decisions to enhance the efficiency for others. I will be graduating in June of 2024 and I am open to roles in Data Analyst and Data Sciencist. 

I am inspired by new innovations that change the way we live, and I am driven to apply my skills and knowledge in this field to make a positive impact on others. 

A little about my background is that I was born and raised in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and moved to the States for high school to further my education. The picture provided above and on the home page is actually the city I grew up in! Outside of school work, cheerleading and track and field were my passions in high school. I also enjoy food hunting, watching crime documentaries, and cooking.
