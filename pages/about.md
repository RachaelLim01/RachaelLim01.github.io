# About

I am a passionate Data Analyst with experience in programming in R and Python, and skills and knowledge in data and statistical analysis. For the past year, I have developed my skill in Data Analysis by taking online Python courses as well as relevant courses in school that can better my abilities in conducting data analysis. I am also part of the Data Science club in school that conducts research and build predictive models in R or Python in various fields ranging from financial to journal articles. I am always eager to learn and will put my best foot forward to anything that I do.
