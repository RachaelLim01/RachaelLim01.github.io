In this project, I analyzed the draft position value and team success/deficiencies compared to expectation, created a method for valueing each drat slot in the NBA draft, and gained insights to productivity score by team.

From this graph above, the model proves to be fairly strong because the value decreases from pick to pick. I forced the quadractic program to pick numbers that decrease by at least 5% from pick to pick in order to produce a smoother graph.

I also analyzed college teams with players that outperformed expectations in the NBA by grouping the data by college and calculate the average value over replacement.

Lastly, I analyze the data by gaining insights into productivity score by team with the above graph as the result of the findings. 

In this project, I have also analyzed the relationship between a team's first round pick in one year with their first-roun pick slot in the subsequent year and the players in the NBA teams.

For this project, I assume I am a Data Scientist working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. 

I extracted financial data like historical share price and quaterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks such as Tesla and GameStop. 

![Graph](/assets/img/4.1.png "Graph")

From the above graph, we can visualize the historical trends of the opening price of Tesla stocks. As shown above, there is a downward trend from end of 2021 to begining of 2023. Tesla's stock lost about 70 percent and this was the result of high inflation rates in the United States accompanied by Musk's acquisition of Twitter. 

Now, we look at historical prices for GameStop and identify any trends in the graph. 

![Graph](/assets/img/4.2.png "Graph")

From the graph above, we can see that GameStop's stocks have been on a downward trend ever since beginning of 2021. After researching GameStop further, the stocks sudden rise was due to Reddit's driven short squeeze, resulting the stock to skyrocket to a split-adjusted all-time high of $86.88 - which represented a 1,740% gain from the beginning of that month. 

But today, GameStop's stock trades at about $25 as it lost its luster as rising inflation rates drove investors away from speculative meme stocks. 


Therefore, as a Data Scientist for the new startup investment firm, I would advise investing into Tesla than GameStop as it has potential for future growth, data shows stronger financial performance in recent years, and the electric vehicle market is expanding with a projected reach of $823.75 billion by 2030.
